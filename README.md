 # Overview

At the beginning of this project I sought to understand how to create a game using python arcade. I achieved that. This game is a platformer game, where a player moves the purple square. Someone must find and collect the five key pieces, and then locate the door to win the game. The player can move the square using the arrow keys. No other controls are needed.

Below is a link to my demonstration on YouTube.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to develop this software, as well as python arcade. All of the code in this software is python. I did not use any libraries other than arcade.

# Future Work

* Add another level
* Use an easier system to place walls and other objects
* Introduce enemies and harmful environment objects
